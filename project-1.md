## FIRST PROJECT

For your first project you'll build a web app using the Sinatra framework. 

The objectives of this project are:

* Build a web app using the Sinatra framework
* Solidify front-end skills by prototyping and building a site using HTML and CSS
* Practice app deployment
* Demonstrate creativity by taking a common base and making it distinctive with styling, theme, etc.
* Focus on HTTP requests


You will be working **individually** for this first project, but we'll be giving you direction this time. Show us what you've got!

##PROJECT CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app:

* Must be able to display all entries on a summary page
* Must be able to select a single entry and navigate to a detail page for that entry
* Must be deployed to Heroku

## PROJECT CHOICES


You may choose to build one of the following applications:
###Blog
* The following attributes are required: Title, Content/Body, List of Tags and/or Keywords, Date.


###Movie
* The following attributes are required: Title, Plot, List of Actors, Release Date.


###Recipes

## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS
These are for extra credit! Don't focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

* Add Search functionality
* Add Sort functionality
* Add the ability to create new items

## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

####Project Plan deliverables (Due ***Friday, January 23rd*** at end of Week 2):

* Wireframes -- app look like? (These must be digital)
* Stories in Trello -- what do your objectives look like, broken down into unit-sized chunks?
* GitHub -- create a repo for your app and show that you've been commiting early and often, while utilizing clear commit messages.


####Completed Project deliverables (Due ***Monday, February 2nd***):

* Link to Trello Board
* Link to Heroku
* Link to source code on GitHub


## TIMELINE

* Project cycle: Weeks 2-3
* Due Date: ***Monday, February 2nd*** (demo optional)
* Code reviews: Week 4

**Something to keep in mind:** you don't have to create your new app on the very first day of a project cycle. In fact, many students in previous WDI programs have waited until week 3 to begin their "real" code (and chose to work on smaller parts of the app independently). 

Work through the lessons in-class, ask questions and come to office hours when you need to, and add code to your app afterwards.


## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code is:

* **Well-formatted.** Are you indenting well? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Sufficiently commented.** Will I understand what is going on in each block or function? If it's not clear, are there comments that indicate what you're doing?
* **Clear.** Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?


We'll also be looking at:

* **Quality of communication around decision-making.** Can you defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you think through alternative implementations?
* **Your ability to pick up new technologies and push yourself.** How did you approach the AngularJS framework and extend your learning into a working game?
